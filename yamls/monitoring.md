# Monitoring
* Prophecy cluster has in-built process(Operators) which performs three step process of Observe->Analyze->Act to fix any issue in Prophecy Cluster. 

* Prophecy Platform layer collects metrics and logs of Prophecy Apps/K8s cluster/Underlying Infra and makes them observable via grafana(metrics) and kibana(logs).

Please deploy [Prophecy Grafana Charts]((https://github.com/SimpleDataLabsInc/onpremdocs/blob/master/yamls/grafana-charts)) to your grafana dashboard for monitoring.
